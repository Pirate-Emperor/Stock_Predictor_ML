# Stock_Predictor_ML

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Stock_Predictor_ML is a machine learning application built with Python that provides users with stock price predictions based on historical data.

## Features

- **Historical Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical stock data from financial APIs or other sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the stock data for machine learning purposes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating new features that could help improve the prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models to train on the historical stock data.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predicts the future stock prices based on the trained machine learning models.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots and charts to visualize the historical data, predicted data, and model performance.

## Components

Stock prediction using machine learning involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze historical data and attempt to predict future stock prices. This is a complex and highly researched area due to its potential for financial gain. Here are some key aspects to consider:

Data: The first step in stock prediction using machine learning is collecting data. This can include historical stock prices, trading volume, and other market-related data. Additionally, other datasets like financial reports, news articles, social media sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators can also be used.

Feature Engineering: This involves transforming raw data into features that are more relevant for prediction. For example, it might involve calculating moving averages, price changes over time, or other technical indicators.

Model Selection: There are various machine learning models that can be used for stock prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks are also popular for time-series data like stock prices.

Training and Testing: Once a model is selected, it needs to be trained using historical data. It's important to have a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it's important to note that even small improvements in prediction accuracy can be significant in stock trading.

Hyperparameter Tuning: This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to improve its performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used for this purpose.

Risk Management: Even the best models can't predict stock prices with 100% accuracy, so it's important to have a risk management strategy in place. This could involve setting stop-loss levels, diversifying investments, or using options to hedge positions.

Continuous Learning: Financial markets are constantly changing, so models need to be retrained and updated regularly to remain effective.

It's important to note that stock prediction is inherently uncertain and risky, and even the best machine learning models can't guarantee profits. Additionally, many factors that influence stock prices, like geopolitical events or regulatory changes, can be difficult to predict or quantify.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, yfinance)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Stock_Predictor_ML.git
cd Stock_Predictor_ML
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter the stock ticker, date range, and prediction window. The application will fetch the historical data, train the machine learning models, predict the future stock prices, and display the results.

## Data Source

The project uses financial APIs such as Yahoo Finance to fetch historical stock data. You can replace the data source or add additional data sources for more comprehensive stock data.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Python scripts in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Implementing more advanced machine learning models and algorithms.
- Incorporating additional features such as technical indicators, news sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic data.
- Developing a user interface for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- Deploying the application as a web service for real-time stock predictions.
